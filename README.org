# Early planning enables you to figure out if you’re biting off more
# than you can chew and helps you determine the structure your game
# will follow.
#
# The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is probably the most important part
# of a short design document. It tells you what you must accomplish to
# make the game - everything else is a bonus.
#
# As you gain experience - and your ambitions grow - you’ll realie
# the benefits of a bit of planning. Don’t overdoit .A small plan s
# better than no plan.
